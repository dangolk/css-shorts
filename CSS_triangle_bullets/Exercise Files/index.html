			<h1>Vegetables</h1>
		</header>

			<p>The exact definition of “vegetable” may vary simply because of the many parts of a plant consumed as food worldwide, including: </p>

			<ul>
				<li>Roots</li>
				<li>Tubers</li>
				<li>Bulbs</li>
				<li>Leaves and Stems</li>
				<li>Flowers</li>
				<li>Fruits</li>
				<li>Seeds</li>
			</ul>

			<p>More specifically, a vegetable may be defined as “any plant, part of which is used for food,” a secondary meaning then being “the edible part of such a plant.” Falling outside these definitions are edible fungi (such as mushrooms) and edible seaweed which, although not parts of plants, are often treated as vegetables.</p>
