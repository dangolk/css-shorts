			<h1>Cinemagraphs</h1>

			<article>
				<p>Cinemagraphs are still photographs in which a minor and repeated movement occurs, forming a video clip. They are published as an animated GIF or in other video formats, and can give the illusion that the viewer is watching an animation.</p>
				<p>Cinemagraphs are made by taking a series of photographs or a video recording and, using image editing software, compositing the photographs or the video frames into a seamless loop. This is done in such a way that motion in part of the subject between exposures is perceived as a repeating or continued motion, in contrast with the stillness of the rest of the image.</p>
