			<h1>Type on an angle</h1>			
			
			<p>Putting type on an angle isn't just for print. This CSS technique can be used in a variety of ways. You can use it to run a paragraph along the same angle as an image or color block. Create a headline for a blog or editorial piece for an impact. Or use the typography as the design.</p>
			
			<p>Explore different angles and orientations. Whatever you choose, have fun with this technique.</p>
