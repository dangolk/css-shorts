			<h1>Floral Design</h1>
			<p>Floral design or floral arts is the art of creating flower arrangements in vases, bowls, baskets, or other containers, or making bouquets and compositions from cut flowers, foliages, herbs, ornamental grasses, and other plant materials. Often the terms “floral design” and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floristry">floristry</a>” are considered synonymous. Florists are people who work with flowers and plants, generally at the retail level.</p>
