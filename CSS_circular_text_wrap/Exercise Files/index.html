			<h1>Editing a Spherical Panorama with Photoshop and After Effects</h1>

			<figure>

			<p>This course was created to teach you one of my workflows for non-destructively editing and branding a spherical panoramic photo, or sometimes called a 360 photo. We’ll do this using Photoshop and After Effects.</p>

			<p>Starting with a real estate image taken on a mostly overcast day, and we’ll begin by seamlessly removing the tripod and table, seen here at the bottom of the image, as well as retouching the lawn and patio, then adding in a new sky. We’ll enhance the photo further by adding in a sun, and adjusting the color to match this effect.</p>

			<p>And finally, we’ll add in a 2 dimensional logo, and distort the logo to match the contours of the “unwrapped” spherical panorama. When we’re finished, we’ll preview the final experience, then upload our enhanced spherical panorama and share it with the world. This course also includes exercise files, including my original 360 photo, so you can follow along even if you don’t have a 360 camera.</p>
