				<h3>What is a spice?</h3>
				<p>A spice is a seed, fruit, root, bark, or other plant substance primarily used for flavoring, coloring or preserving a food. Spices are distinguished from herbs, which are the leaves, flowers, or stems from plants used for flavoring or as a garnish. Sometimes, spices may be ground into a powder for convenience. Many spices have antimicrobial properties.</p>

				<h3>What is an herb? </h3>
				<p>Herbs are any plants used for food, flavoring, medicine, or fragrances for their savory or aromatic properties. Culinary use typically distinguishes herbs from spices. Herbs refers to the leafy green or flowering parts of a plant (either fresh or dried), while spices are produced from other parts of the plant (usually dried), including seeds, berries, bark, roots and fruits.</p>
